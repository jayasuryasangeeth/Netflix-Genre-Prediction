# Netflix Genre Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the genres of Netflix content based on various attributes such as titles, descriptions, cast, director, and release year. By leveraging multiple machine learning algorithms, the project evaluates and compares the performance of these models in accurately classifying genres.

## Skills Utilized
- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Model Tuning and Optimization**
- **Programming**
- **Problem-Solving**
- **Documentation and Reporting**

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **SciPy**
- **IPython**


Open the `Netflix_genre_prediction.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially to:
1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Train multiple machine learning models.
4. Evaluate and compare the models.
5. View the results and visualizations.

## Model Evaluation
The models used in the project include:
- RandomForestClassifier
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- LogisticRegression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- KNeighborsClassifier

The evaluation is based on accuracy metrics, with RandomForestClassifier achieving the highest accuracy.

## Results
The project demonstrates that the RandomForestClassifier is the most effective model for predicting Netflix genres, achieving an accuracy of approximately 79.86%. This model can be used to enhance Netflix's recommendation system, content categorization, and marketing strategies.
